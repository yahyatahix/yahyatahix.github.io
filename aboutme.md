**Today**

I am an associate professor (teaching &amp; research) at [Telecom ParisTech][1] (the old name is ENST - Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Telecommunications) since september 2012. Funny fact: in 1904 this engineer school invented the word "[telecommunication][2]" :smile: !

**Yesterday**

In 2010, I joined [INRIA][3] - [LaBRI][4] as a post-doctoral research scientist and I taught at [ENSEIRB-MATMECA][5], both located in Bordeaux, France.

**The day before yesterday**

I was born in Sherbrooke, Canada but my parents quickly moved first to Paris, then south to Toulouse. A big part of my family is living in Poland and in some other spots of the world (USA, Canada, U.K., Germany). Fortunately and because of that, I love to travel !

**Tomorrow**

Feel free to contact me for research projects (consulting offers, job inquiries, expertise requests, reference requests, getting back in touch) ! The main keywords of my research are: distributed systems, autonomic computing and networking protocols. However, I'm also interested in more "marketing-or-buzzing-and-not-so-much-academic" keywords like cloud computing, grid computing, green computing, green-IT, datacenter management, smart-\*, smart-things, internet of things IoT, MOOC: see the [academic page](/academic/) for more details.
