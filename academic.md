## Main interests

My research focuses on **Autonomic Computing** and its application to **large scale distributed systems** (Clouds, [Smart-]Grids, Wireless Sensor Networks, [Smart-]Systems, Pervasive and Mobile Computing). I intend to discover and tackle both the technological bottlenecks and the conceptual concerns inherent in every complex systems' management.

The problem of the growing complexity leads to tremendous challenges like the ability for the system to manage and dynamically adapt itself (self-configuring, self-healing, self-protecting and self-optimizing) in accordance with policies and objectives.

The **coordination** of multiple autonomic control loops, the **stability** and the **consistency** of the managed complex systems are of particular interest to me.

### Thesis

I defended my thesis in computer science at the University of Toulouse on December 12th, 2010. Its title is "Autonomic computing for performance improvements, energy savings and quality of service. Application to wireless sensor networks, wired networks and grid computing".

The main challenge of this thesis is to cope with the growing complexity of IT systems. In a near future (mainly the next few years) this complexity will prevent new developments and system evolutions. Today the trend is reversing and the managing costs are overtaking the hardware and software costs. Moreover, the manual administration of large systems (distributed applications, sensor networks, and network equipment) is not only slow but error-prone. An emerging research field called autonomic computing tries to bring up self-managed systems. We introduce an approach that enable the description of high level autonomic management policies. These policies allow the system to ensure four fundamental properties for self-management: self-healing, -self-configuring, self-protecting and self-optimizing. We specify autonomic management Policy Description Diagrams (PDD) and implement them in Toulouse University Network (TUNe). We validated our approach on many systems: electromagnetic simulations distributed on computer grids (grid'5000), wireless sensor networks with SunSPOTs and the computing scheduler DIET. A second part of this thesis presents a mathematical modeling for self-optimizing datacenters. We introduce a minimization problem with a criterion integrating both the electrical consumption of the datacenter networking equipment and the quality of service given to the deployed applications. A heuristic takes into account the routing functions used on the network.

Keywords: autonomic management, autonomic computing, self-management, self-configuration, self-healing, self-protection, self-optimization, modeling, meta-modeling, autonomic computing models, autonomic computing policies, wireless sensor networks, WSN, energy, electrical consumption, electrical power, green-IT, quality of service, QoS
