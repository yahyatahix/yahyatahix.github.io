Here is some information about how I created my academic website [http://www.remisharrock.fr](http://www.remisharrock.fr)

#### Source code
The source code is entirely and publicly available on Github here: [https://github.com/remisharrock/remisharrock.github.io/tree/master](https://github.com/remisharrock/remisharrock.github.io/tree/master)

I use the famous free and open source [ATOM editor](https://atom.io/) to edit this source code. It originated from some Github folks ([their blog](http://blog.atom.io/)) and has grown to a [big community](https://discuss.atom.io/) that produces a lot of [powerful open source magic](https://github.com/atom). Take a look at their [funny vintage ATOM 1.0 launching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk) !

#### Hosting provider
I use the free [Github pages hosting](https://pages.github.com/) to store all the website data (text, images, source code), to compile the source code to static HTML, to serve the pages with their servers and their bandwidth. Because it's free, [I am obviously the product](https://www.quora.com/Who-originally-suggested-that-if-youre-not-paying-for-the-product-you-are-the-product), and I rely on their infrastructure. If the wrong part of their infrastructure fails on day, my website will fail. You can check the status and the outage history on the [Github system status page](https://status.github.com/).

#### Domain Name ".fr"
I pay my domain name "remisharrock.fr" yearly, to the french leader [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/).
It used to cost 4,99€ per year (5,97€ tax included) but around 2013-2015 OVH decided to raise it to 6,99€ per year (8,39€ tax included). That's only to get the name, nothing else!

I then configured the link between the domain name and Github pages hosting as explain by the manual [about custom domains for github pages sites](https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/).

Anyway we should all consider switching to something like [Open Roots](http://www.open-root.eu/).
They are selling Top Level Domains (TLDs), not renting. It is another concept of internet naming, a simple idea developed by [Louis Pouzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pouzin) (retired professor at my school), inventor of the datagram, one of the basic internet protocols.
It costs 200€ only once in your life and you get a root name for yourself, like ".whatyouwant". The pitfall is that everyone has to change its DNS servers manually to "open the roots" and access my website...

#### Theming and icons
This website tries to follow a little bit of [Google design guidelines](https://design.google.com/). More specifically, it uses [Google material design principles](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) and its implementation by [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com/).

Icons are from [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

#### Static site generated by Jekyll
This website is a static site generated by [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/). Most of the source code is compiled from text files filled with [Markdown syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to static HTML. However, both the Markdown syntax and the Jekyll compiler are specialized for Github Pages because I use their free hosting services. Indeed, the syntax is called GFM [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) and the compiler is a specialized [Jekyll version bundled by Github](https://github.com/github/pages-gem).

#### Generating the website

To generate the website and test it locally on port 40001, I followed the documentation [using Jekyll with Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and use this command line:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --port 40001
